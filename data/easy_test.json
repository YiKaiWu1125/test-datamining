The fragrance is pleasant. It goes on smoothly, not tacky. I use it at night before bed. I have dry psoriasis patches near my ears and this Ceramide Complex does not burn or irritated that skin. It takes time and several uses for this type of product to see a real effect. I'm planning on continued usage to see how it goes.

The hair is soft so far but it has only been worn once so that's not a real indication of how good it will hold up.  Of course, it's a hard front, not lace front so it needs some adjustments to make it look natural. The part isn't natural looking but you could tweeze/pluck it to make it look natural.

Durags ate also worn for fashion, so people who make durags should be a little more tasteful with the sewing and threading job. I think this is a good durag.

It smells really good, it's just missing a few notes that the other products have. It mostly smells like vanilla with maybe a slight hint of caramel.<br />It's very moisturizing, I love how it feels on my lips, and overall it is a high quality lip balm that's worth it's price tag.
