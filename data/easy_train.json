This unit has a charge light (blinks until charged) while there is no such light on the comparably priced Waterpik. This device has about the same sized reservoir as the Waterpik, but because of the design, it\u2019s on the bottom as opposed to along the sides of the unit, the result being that it makes it a lot bulkier, which is unfortunate in a travel water flosser. Unfortunately, there is no advantage to this design as like the Waterpik, it begins to stop pumping water as the tank gets lower, forcing the user to keep the unit vertical in order to get to the water at the very bottom of the reservoir, which can become quite awkward while trying to get around the teeth and gums. I\u2019ve owned several of these, and to be fair, they all suffer from this same problem.<br /><br />One more thing: this unit comes with a nice case and a stash of attachments (which are usually found in home units and don\u2019t generally come with portable units ,) none of which I have much use for, but I guess it\u2019s good to know they\u2019re there.

Mostly what I don't care for this brush vs Doodles is the handle. It is a little more narrow so it's a teensy bit less comfortable to hold. I have carpel tunnel. I've been grooming cats furever & grooming English angora rabbits for well over a decade.<br /><br />\ud83d\udc31For short & long haired cats, this brush works great. All of my cats love this brush & my Doodles brand. I can comb all of them except for my 14yo with a surprising amount of pressure & they roll around purring. Tons of hair gets picked up into the tines. Unlike some styles of brushes & combs, no hair is left behind around the tail area.<br /><br />Removing the hair from the brush is very easy. Start at one side from the bottom to loosen & then move to the other side. Keep working your way around & it comes off in a nice clean loose mat. I actually prefer these types of slicker brushes over self cleaning brushes & also over brushes with the little plastic beads on the ends. If you groom your animal properly, you don't need little balls on the ends of the tines. Those balls also make it a little harder to get the brush fully clean of hair.<br /><br />Cosmetically, I like the look of the brush much better than my Doodles brush. This is all black with a more classy branding in small white text on the head. We Love Doodles is blue & loudly brands itself on the head.<br /><br />\ud83d\udc30I don't recommend this style of brush for English angora rabbits. I have found that my bunnies seem to be more comfortable with smaller slickers with shorter tines. You'd think with their dense long coats, you'd want something large with long tines, but it really doesn't work out like you'd expect. At least for me it doesn't.<br /><br />\ud83d\udc30Recommended for English Angora Rabbits:<br /><br />\ud83d\udc07Doggy Man sells a small soft slicker brush that my angora rabbits love. It's plastic with a little blue ring on the handle. I have purchased/replaced many of them over the years (the handles tend to break over time) because they work well.<br />\ud83c\udf10 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NLVFH2<br />\ud83d\udc07I also recommend if money allows, a small slicker brush by Chris Christensen. I've never needed to replace it.<br />\ud83c\udf10 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GU7NKWW<br /><br />Personally, I'd shop between this brand (Rita's), We Love Doodles, & Chris Christensen. Chris Christensen is top of the line. They are worth it if you have the money. We Love Doodles has been the middle ground for me. They were originally priced at $50, but the price has been a lot lower for a while now. Rita's is currently the second most expensive & probably the lowest quality of the three brands. However, I've been using it for the least amount of time, so it's too early to know for sure.

The box is very cute, with the words \"It's a great day to love your face\" greeting you when you open the box.

The blue eye mask is filled with gel beads so you can use it hot or cold, and the cheapest and least impressive items are the \"facial buff\" (a pear-shaped sponge that looks like something you'd clean your pots with) and a  \"facial cleansing brush\" that looks a little cheap but is nevertheless useful.<br /><br />The main thing that was missing was some packing peanuts or confetti, as the items were tossed into the box hither and thither with NO padding, whereas other gift baskets and boxes typically include some stuffing so that the items are more artfully displayed.

However, this lotion has been easier to determine because it instantly lends a dewy, supple, perfectly moisturized skin that lasts all day and night (or night and day in my case as I have been using it at night). Anything else it is a doing for me is a bonus, and I know will take time, but right now the instant effect is lovely feeling, radiant skin.<br /><br /> It is a thin, light lotion but it is rich.

I found a serum here on Amazon that contains 17% L-ascorbic acid, and I've been using it for approx. 3 weeks.  What a difference!  I can definitely feel it working for one thing (it burns for about 5 seconds), but more importantly, I can SEE the difference in my skin already.  At first I thought my eyesight was going downhill, but then I realized my skin really did look smoother and had a new glow.  Do an Amazon search for L-ascorbic Vitamin C serum to get the good stuff.<br /><br />Having said all this, I have added a LOT more spinach to my daily regimen lately, so I'm sure that's contributing to my skin's appearance too.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I finished the bottle which gave me about 5 weeks of use.  If it made any difference in my skin, it's at a microscopic level.  I'm buying another bottle - mainly because there's got to be SOME truth to all the 5-star reviews.  But if, after another month or so of use, I still don't see improvement in my skin, I'm asking a dermatologist for a Rx for Retin-A.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I've been using this product for three weeks, and I have yet to see any improvement in my skin.  I'm amazed (and not a little skeptical) about some people seeing results in two weeks.  I also wonder how many 5-star reviews were written by people who were given the product to try.<br /><br />I'm very methodical about using new products on my skin.  I use a 10x magnifying mirror, establish a &#34;baseline&#34; area of my skin to observe over time, and take close-up &#34;selfies&#34; of my skin to compare with photos taken a few weeks later.  No difference so far, but I'll continue to use this product until it's gone.<br /><br />I DO like that this retinol doesn't irritate my skin, which is highly unusual.  So unusual, it makes me wonder if it indeed contains any retinol.<br /><br />In conclusion, and not a critique of the product itself, but the product won't dispense through the pump.  It's too thick.  I'm having to pull the cap off and shake the serum on to my fingertips. I wish it came with a dropper instead.  I changed out out the pump with a dropper from another bottle of serum.  I'm surprised I haven't read about this problem in other reviews.

As a starter there were no instructions other than to apply generously twice a day.  They fail to tell you to expect extreme burning pain that lasts 4 hours!  They don't mention if you can apply your normal skincare products with it or not.  They don't say if or how you can lessen the burning pain.  I have never felt any pain like this on my face.  Not even bad sun burn feels this bad.  They didn't mention that  you would continue to feel this burning pain the entire 30 days or not.  Keep in mind you are supposed to apply twice a day.  So that meant 8 hours a day of the burning pain.  On day 21 the pain only lasted 1 hour with each application.  I feel sure I am one of the few who would put up with the burning pain.  On day 28 I did the first application, but I just could not endure another application, so I threw it in a box and gave up.  The only reason I endured as long as I did was because on day 5 I did notice an improvement in the wrinkles.  However by day 28 there was no more wrinkle improvement and I noticed big red splotches of broken blood vessels on my face and my skin felt like sand paper.  At that point I gave up on this product.

Once I was finally able to get enough product out, I dried my teeth (after flossing and brushing first) and wiped the silicone bristles onto my teeth from premolar to  premolar on my upper and lower teeth, I used the box it came in to fan and dry off my teeth. I did this before bed time so I wouldn\u2019t have the urge to eat or drink after. The gel will become stringy once your inner lips and cheek touch the gel and there\u2019s a mild taste to it.  So far I\u2019ve used this pen nightly for 4 days and I\u2019ve seen a tiny bit of results. You\u2019re supposed to use it twice a day for 2 weeks. I haven\u2019t experienced any sensitivity from the gel, partly because I\u2019ll use sensodyne toothpaste to brush and the gel is formulated with potassium nitrate that helps prevent sensitivity.

Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.

It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.

Then paint the top coat over the regular color, cure, wipe with cleanser and enjoy your stunning, long lasting nails! The only thing I would change about this set is the light.

I ended up finally doing the smarter thing and going to Target to sample other versions and got another Secret spray there. Lesson learned.

I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help.  The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion. It did not cause burning/itching, etc.  When the time was up, I removed the socks and cleaned my feet.<br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />Day 1 (the day after I did the treatment)-nothing<br /><br />Day 2-VERY light peeling-more like little 'threads' of skin<br /><br />Day 3-Actual peeling -I was pulling some decent pieces of skin off of both feet<br /><br />Day 4-WOW...BIG pieces of peeling skin! (unfortunately, I had already started to peel off the skin when I remembered to take a picture for this review...the picture does not show just how much peeling had actually taken place)<br /><br />Day 5-Very little peeling-mainly on toes<br /><br />Day 6-Next to no peeling<br /><br />Day 7 & 8-No peeling at all<br /><br />Results:<br /><br />The bottom of my feet are soft and pink with the exception of my heels. Those are my trouble areas. Calluses are very thick and cracked on my heels.  (a million times worse during winter months!) I DID have some progress on my heels but nowhere near the rest of my feet.  I used the scraper (? not sure if that's what it's called) and made a bit of progress.  I wish now that i had wiped some of the lotion directly on my heels when I wore the socks.  When I do my next treatment, I will absolutely rub some lotion directly on my heels when I start.  I'm impressed and thrilled with the results.  Its flip flop season and my feet aren't always pretty to look at.  This foot peel really helped.  I absolutely recommend Monikahair foot peel if your feet are dry and cracked. They're going to look and feel SO much better after using this treatment!

I know I love honey and I love using it or having it in my beauty products, so I was looking forward to receiving this product to test it out.<br /><br />There are some actual product packaging concerns that really should be addressed by the company that makes this body scrub. First off, the jar is pretty sturdy, I\u2019m not going to dispute that and it\u2019s amber, which is always good in helping keep out UV rays. The ONLY seal is the Amazon barcode label (One of the photos shows the label, but I cut through it, it was intact when it arrived - so that was not the issue). There was no shrink wrap seal, neither was there an inner seal, nor one of those inner lid liners. This jar also does not have ANY other labeling except for that Amazon barcode and the top label with their website URL. This was a standalone jar, no box. There is no product information on the jar, no ingredient list, no product name, no manufacture or expiration dates. This brings up heavy red flags for me \u2013 quality control especially.<br /><br />The product description sounds rather amazing, right? Ok, keep in mind what I previously mentioned about quality control. In their description they advertise that you can EAT it. I\u2019d recommend against it because of the lack of quality sealing. It would be one thing if this were given to me by someone who I knew personally that had made the product, but since this is coming from a company that I don\u2019t know and that doesn\u2019t have anything other than the description on Amazon, I\u2019m not sticking this product in my mouth. I know the anti-bacterial properties of honey, however, that doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be contaminated by anything else -1) it\u2019s not pure honey, there are other ingredients within, 2) who knows the health/sanitation practices of this company, right?, 3) with there just being the barcode label as a seal, who\u2019s to say that someone couldn\u2019t have tampered with it in the warehouse?, and 4) their only label \u2013 the one I mentioned with their website URL \u2013 if you go to the URL, it comes up with:<br /><br />\u201cThis webpage is not available<br /><br />ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED\u201d<br /><br />I don\u2019t know about you, but without anything reputable to back up the product or company, I find it very hard for me to trust this.<br /><br />ALL of that aside, if you can look past those packaging and trust issues, getting to the actual product\u2026<br /><br />When you open the cover, it does have that very rich strong scent of honey. The brown sugar and other ingredients have settled to the bottom, so some stirring was necessary \u2014 the honey is also pretty solid, so a cosmetic spatula (not included) was not adequate enough to stir it.  Once you do stir it, the scent of the brown sugar comes through.  Because it\u2019s honey, it\u2019s really sticky, and like any sugar scrub, it has that gritty sugar texture which is great for exfoliation.  If your skin is dry when you apply, you may have a tough time spreading it, to avoid this, moisten your skin prior to smoothing this along.<br /><br />It does its job at exfoliating, removing a layer of dead skin, but I didn\u2019t expect that it wouldn\u2019t. The product itself is good, leaves the skin smooth and smells good \u2013 I used it on my leg.<br /><br />It\u2019s not proprietary though, since there are a ton of DIY tutorials on how to make sugar scrubs out on the web nowadays. But if you\u2019re not into making your own and if they change the packaging and labeling and get a working website up, then this would be the way to go.<br /><br />I really hope that they get the concerns I mentioned in the beginning straightened out. It would have been a decent product all around if not for those issues. If they do, then I'd be more than happy to bump the rating to a 4.

Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn\u2019t what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product\u2026<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It\u2019s really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading \u201cSkin Set Go.\u201d  If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company\u2019s website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company\u2019s website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I\u2019d personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It\u2019s very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it\u2019s unique, it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s memorable. However, there\u2019s a ton of plastic used that isn\u2019t necessary, and with the design, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you\u2019re looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.", "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not like the picture", "text": "The blonde highlights are way more chunky than the picture.

Comes down to preference. I use dry shampoo often. I prefer the powder over the spray. I find they work better and for a longer period of time over the spray. Sprays tend to work quicker, so if you are not used to powder variety, know that you have to give it some time. So apply this, let it sit on hair for a bit before combing through. Then comb through and maybe add more. Go finish getting dressed or whatever, then finish combing hair and finishing off your style. OR apply some before bed and wake up to fresh hair.<br /><br />It doesn't take much. I have used other brands with similarly small containers, and the stuff lasts forever even with frequent use. This is a little smaller at 1.5 ounces, which they state is travel size-- but it will still provide many applications. At $9.99, I think the price is great (even though I do not rate on price)- and I will likely buy this again but in the dark hair option (more about that in a moment).  This is a nozzle tip dispenser. Squeeze bottle to get it to disperse. Be sure to take the protective seal off from inside the cap. Mine was stuck up in the cap. It took me a few humorous attempts to get the product out from nozzle before I realized that the safety seal was caught up inside. Once I got through that snafu, all was good to go.<br /><br />I failed to see that this is for \"light hair\". It is a pale yellow powder. \"This particular shampoo is optimized for light hair, so if your hair is blonde, red, or strawberry blonde, this \u2018poo is for you\". Not all dry shampoo makes the distinction, but some do. So if/when I purchase the dark hair option (which they have, and I will link below), I imagine it will be a darker powder. But it really doesn't matter!!!  Many of the dry shampoo powders are white, so I figured this would be the same in terms of overall look. If not too much is used, and if it is brushed out well enough rarely is there any noticeable haze. Again, I am used to working with the powder form so it comes easy to me to get it to work.<br /><br />My hair was freshened up as expected. A light lift. Not a massive amount of volume, though over course of day I noticed it seemed more full (I have very long hair, so the roots will be weighed down a bit at first). No problems. I like it. So far the product comes out from the nozzle well.<br /><br />DARK HAIR option: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084JCXT18<br /><br />PS.  dry shampoo can often be used as a body powder too. Look for formulas like this- just some clay and other body friendly ingredients.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Zea Mays (Corn Starch), Organic Maranta Arundinacea (Arrowroot) Powder, Yellow (Kaolin & Illite) Clay , Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), Organic Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Powder, Organic Lavandula Hybrida (Lavander) Oil<br /><br />How to Use Organic Dry Shampoo<br /><br />1. Give your shampoo bottle a good shake. 2. Part your hair into several segments. 3. Hold your shampoo bottle about six inches away from your head. Squeeze until you see fine powder particles falling onto your hair. 4. Using a makeup brush or your fingertips, massage your shampoo into your scalp.

After reading the reviews I was hopeful for good results with little mess.  Well, the results were just under satisfying and the mess was exactly what I was worried about.<br />It\u2019s chalk, I get it. But there were so many reviews saying the color stayed in and didn\u2019t rub off onto white clothing! Thank goodness my daughter\u2019s costume was black.  Though we could still see blue/green on her shoulders and back. Her neck was blue/green for 3 days. And after 3 showers her hair still had color in it.<br />We used leave in conditioner and hairspray since I read many reviews advocating for them.  I think if your hair is short, this could benefit you. My daughters hair is long and thick, and it was awful. I tried not to brush, but I inevitably had to comb horrible knots caused by the chalk being rubbed onto damp hair. (And a spray bottle is a must, chalk on dry hair is a joke.) This caused much of the color to fly away in clouds of chalk.<br />True, her hair was colored blue/green, but it was not the vibrant color that initially came off of the chalk. It was muted at best.<br /><br />I strongly recommend doing this outside and with clothing on you don\u2019t care about. Any tools you use in the process will subsequently get chalk all over it.

And the remaining color will slowly work itself out on your clothes, chairs, couches, pillows, and eventually multiple showers.<br />I will say I chose chalk over dye for the benefit of no chemicals on my girl or in my house.

So for that I guess there is no issue to the product integrity. The consistency of the gel cream is pretty much the way that they describe it, it's thickness is like that of a cream but does feel cooling like a gel. I had applied it while my face was still slightly damp after a shower so it didn't absorb too quickly due to the moisture already on my skin. It did feel soothing once I smooth it all over my skin. It had a fresh clean scent to it and it did not irritate my skin. But once it dried and fully absorbed into my skin, I still felt like my skin was a little bit tight and still needed extra moisture. So I did end up adding another layer of facial moisturizer of a different brand that I normally use.

Very nice colors, but more subdued than bold, more satin/shimmer than metallic.  This is my first Ulta palette and I am happy with the quality.  I only deducted one star because the colors are somewhat other than expected.  I paid $12.<br /><br />I specifically bought it for the green color, and I still like the green color, but it's not as bright or as metallic as the collection name caused me to expect.  The finish is something of a shimmering satin, not metallic.  The colors are somewhat subdued.  The package says &#34;jewel tones&#34; which may be more accurate than the &#34;metals&#34; description, but still (to me) implies more brightly colored shades, with fewer earth tones.  I would also expect a &#34;jewel toned&#34; palette to include a strong purple, and this only has the lilac (Dynasty). (The Royal looks purple but swatched brown with a hint of burgundy.) The colors are more woodsy than jeweled.  The green is more mossy than emerald, the purple more floral than jeweled, the blue more night sky than sapphire.<br /><br />The quality of the shadows is good.  Neither buttery nor powdery, it's a slightly dry formula that nevertheless doesn't kick up a lot of product or cause a lot of fall out.  I wear them over a primer, but I have been happy with their wear time.  As stated above, pigmentation is good in that you don't have to build heavily, but it's also not a bright coloring.<br /><br />A lovely bonus is that I actually love the brush that comes with this item!  How often do you say that about a brush in a palette?  It's not only soft and usable, it's unique among my brush collection.  It's flufflier and less flat that most brushes of it's size, and it's also smaller and more pinpointed that most brushes that have a bit of fluffiness to them.  Overall, I feel like it gives good control while still blending well.  It's quickly become a favorite brush.<br /><br />There may have been a naming crisis when creating this palette, lol.  As the palette name is Metals, the subtitle is Jewels, and every individual shade is named with a royalty/gentry theme.  The shares are: Noble (white), Lady (pale pink), Reign (earthy pink), Crown (gold), Dynasty (lilac), Royal (brown), Honor (platinum), Jester (silver), Armor (bronze),  Fortress (green), Duchess (navy), and Duke (off black).  No mattes, all satin/shimmer.  All smooth, no fall out, some apply more evenly than others (drier formula).  Swatched dry on dry skin in photo.  Will build to brighter, more shiny finish.<br /><br />I ordered this palette on a whim, and I've enjoyed it.

It says to lightly spritz the mask and then heat it for 30 seconds in the microwave, which I did, but since it didn't feel hot enough, I put it back in the microwave for another 30 seconds and, for me, that was the perfect temperature.<br /><br />Cold: I tried freezing it to use on my eyes, since my allergies have been killing me this season and my eyes have been quite puffy and itchy, and I must say that I was rather pleased.

This sits on top of dense, well packed brown paper grass. Each product is carefully nestled underneath. The products look good and they smell good. Really good-- not cloying and cheap. Just pleasant. The entire unboxing experience was pleasant, and I would totally buy this for someone. You know how some gift compilations look cheap? This has a classy, artsy look that I would be proud to give to someone.<br /><br />This will probably be my go to gift item for anyone who enjoys these sorts of products. Set comes with lip balm, a bath bomb, a scrub, a cream, a bar of soap, and a soy candle. I'll use everything.

I have used cheaper irons that have had much better results.", "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "It's not what I thought it would be", "text": "I gave this 3 stars for \"Softness\" because the brush is average to a bit firmer than what would be ideal and comfortable to use on your back, while the loofah strap is average.  The brush bristles are kind of scratchy and not the \"good exfoliating\" kind of scratchy.  They're more like the \"ouch, that's scratching me\" kind of scratchy.  Overall, though, it's acceptable and average.<br /><br />Next, I gave this 2 stars for \"Easy to use\" because I don't find this easy to use.  The brush is separate from the stick that extends it to reach your back; you slide the oval-shaped brush onto the stick by inserting the stick into a cut out section on the back side brush.  The problem here is that it doesn't stay on firmly at all.  I ended up with 2 options:  either not on firmly enough, so it kept popping off, or pushed on so much that it's very difficult to get off of the stick to use separately.  The loofah strap is really easy to use, though.  It's nice and long so there's plenty of length to comfortably hold each end and move it back and forth at most angles, no matter how thin or thick your arms or body may be.  That's a real plus!  But I still couldn't give more stars if only half of the set is easily usable.<br /><br />Finally, I gave this 4 stars for sturdiness because there's no doubt, it seems pretty sturdy.  The bristles on the brush have stayed intact.  The loofah strap is firm and sewn solidly -- but it may be too firm.  It's hard to get flexibility out of it.  The elastic strap handle on the brush is flimsy, but overall, it's a solid set.  The wood is a good, solid, well-finished wood without splits or cracks.

Here is what he had to say after using it:<br /><br />I've used Norelco shavers for years, but never a \"wet\" system, so I was quite interested to compare the Cool Skin 8040X to my old shaver. When I first opened the package and set the shaver up, I had to not only charge the batteries but also fill the shaver with Nivea For Men shaving conditioner. This was no problem following the easy to read instruction manual.<br /><br />To begin shaving, you first press the on/off button on the shaver to turn it on and then press the conditioner release button. This pumps a small amount of conditioner out of holes in the center of two of the three shaver heads. Then you shave as you normally would with an electric shaver. I found that I use three pumps of conditioner while shaving: one for each side of my face and one for my neck.<br /><br />Although I have a tough beard, I have sensitive skin. Because of this, in recent years I've starting shaving every other day. So when I shave my beard is a little bit longer than most men's would normally be. The shaver has no problem coping with this. It cuts clean with no pulling on the hairs. However, it begins to have problems with three days of growth.<br /><br />I also have a mustache and goatee, which has always caused me to use a razor to shave along its edge. The same applies when using the Cool Skin, but with less irritation as it is now being done with skin conditioner in place instead of on dry skin.<br /><br />The shaver also comes with a beard trimming device. Just snap off the triple shave head and replace it with the trimmer. (Conditioner cannot be used when the trimmer is installed.) The only real fault with the Cool Skin is this trimmer which, frankly, is useless. It just doesn't want to cut any hairs. But then, the one on my old Norelco is the same way.<br /><br />I also find the conditioner application button is in a position that I want to place my fingers when using the shaver, so occasionally I'll get an extra, unneeded dose of conditioner. A pretty minor issue.<br /><br />The Cool Skin can also be used in the shower, but I have not tried this as I'm blind as a bat without my glasses on.<br /><br />I find that the results of my shave are the same whether I use my old standard Norelco or this new Norelco Cool Skin 8040X, with one exception: \u00ad there is much less skin irritation with the Cool Skin.

The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.

I was looking very forward to having these soaps to add some holiday cheer to my home.<br /><br />Here's what happened. The person that purchased it for me was so overwhelmed by the strong scent that he had to triple bag the box and store it in a vacant room until Christmas. Each soap is individually wrapped. They're wrapped in plastic. Then in a box. Then they're double bagged in two ziploc bags. Then placed in yet another box, wrapped with wrapping paper. The box was under my tree for two days, and scent still managed to seep out and perfume all the other gifts under the tree nearby - but not in a pleasant way. When this was unwrapped Christmas morning it was so unbelievably overpowering my eyes watered. I didn't even bother to look closely at them - I could not get them back inside their ziplocs fast enough. People got headaches and complained loudly.. The entire downstairs smelled like a soap factory instead of the fresh cinnamon rolls I baked for Christmas morning. The soaps are now safely contained in their hazmat bags and stored in the laundry room instead of the guest bath. :(<br /><br />I'm really kind of bummed about this because I was so excited about these soaps. I want to try them or at least take them out and smell each one on its own, but I'm afraid to now.<br /><br />Greenwich Bay, if you read these reviews: please, please, PLEASE turn the scent levels down several notches in the recipe for these soaps.

The adapter isn\u2019t included but I use my phones charging adapter and it works fine), 1 Pink Nail File with strong grit on both sides of the file and a blue buffer on one side and then a white side on the back that I use to make my real nails shiny) and last but not least a small storage container with secure clasps and a handle for safe storage as well as a instruction booklet.<br /><br />THIS KIT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE RUBBING ALCOHOL YOU MUST HAVE WHEN DOING THESE TYPE OF NAILS!

I definitely suggest buying one that is more heavy duty and has higher wattage (you can always use it on gel nails or on regular polish to cut drying time in half) and #2 The nail color doesn\u2019t have any way of telling which bottle is what color.

Like, &#34;I have to make my own ponytail holders because the regular ones aren't big enough&#34; thick. And I live in Houston where our humidity can best be described as &#34;lol good luck.&#34; Suffice to say, it's a little bit of a problem especially, during the wet season. I decided it was time to start looking a little bit more polished, and to that end I did some research and saw some really good videos on similar products and was directed here because of the low price and good ratings. Reader, it works. The temperature gauge is in celcius, but that wasn't really a problem. I used it on 205-210 and it only took me about 10 minutes to get my hair flat. And when I say &#34;flat&#34; I'm not talking about pin straight, which I had been a little afraid of. If I'd gone up to the 235 that may have happened, but 205 was just about perfect to leave my hair just a hint of a curl at the ends that looks like I intentionally put it there. I'd actually been concerned about that, because the last time I used a straightener I was in high school and I remember it gave me those super flat ends that look like you've straightened it. This is a much more natural look. I experimented with a few different things and what worked best for me was brushing my bangs straight up to give them a little more volume and then the rest of it I just brushed like it was a regular hairbrush. No sectioning hair, no going back with a curling iron to put texture back in, and no burns! The little rubber dealies do their job well, and I was able to touch them with the palm of my hand with no discomfort at all. It even got the super coarse curls around the back of my neck with no problems. I can run my fingers through my hair like a regular person without stopping to untangle anything!<br /><br />My only quibble would be that the location of the buttons (right on the handle) made it difficult to use without accidentally turning it off or adjusting the pressure, but it does make a nice loud beep when it happened so it was more of an annoyance than anything else and it may be one of those things that gets easier once you're used to it.", "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Holy Cow Badgers Are SOFT!!!", "text": "100% badger hair, which I guess is a good thing, I've been told by men that that's a good thing.

When you open it there is a mirror, and a plastic covering to protect your cushion and store your sponge, I really like this because it keeps the cushion from drying out and rubbing on your sponge wasting product when you aren't using it.<br />The product itself goes on really well, it feels lighter and more silky than a liquid foundation. It provides medium coverage and doesn't feel cakey or thick.  The applicator sponge has one side to apply the product and the other side has a ribbon on the back that you can use to hold it without having to touch your fingers on the front.<br />I ordered the color 104 which was listed as medium/light pink (it is the second to lightest color.)

However You Get What You Pay For Though!", "text": "UPDATE: 08-01-21<br /><br />Its been nearly another year that I've owned these shavers, which makes a total of 3-years of ownership. Has my opinion on these shavers changed? Well, one just has to take a look at my updated rating and you have your answer. About a month after my first replacement, (which you can read about in the 2020 update) I discovered that the battery wasn't holding a charge as good as my first shaver, it got so bad that the charger would die, unless I had it plugged in all the time. This did not give me confidence at all!<br /><br />Also, the cutting head from the get go, felt like it wasn't as sharp as the first shavers cutting head. I mean, we all know the blade isn't made out of Japanese steel but this is ridiculous, a new shaver head should be sharp! Because I did not want to write this product off too soon, I continued using the shaver for almost a complete year, and now the shaver head feels as dull as the last shaver after 2-years of use. For an entire year, this shaver was providing me a nice shade of red rash on my neck, nothing like walking into a store looking like you just came back from getting tortured by someone.<br /><br />I simply could not put up with it anymore, and I am sorry to have to admit this, but I went back to a name brand shaver. I did my research, and I discovered that Panasonic was still making quality shavers made in Japan. I decided to also switch from a rotary design shaver, to a foil design shaver, as they provide a closer shave. The Panasonic Arc4 ES 8243AA is a much nicer shaver hands down! If you want to take 30-minutes for a red rash shave, then stick with Aefee, if you want a 10-minute shave that leaves you looking good afterwords, get the Panasonic.<br /><br />Review has been updated to 3 out of 5 stars as of August 1st 2021...<br /><br />UPDATE: 09-05-20<br /><br />My wonderful shaver has recently been pulling my hairs, and taking twice as long to shave, which is due to the shaving head being dull. I went searching for replacement heads for my shaver, saw that there used to be some that were sold on Amazon, but they are out of stock, with no confidence that they will be back in stock, anytime soon. I saw that this shaver was still being sold to this day, and for cheaper then before! I thought, for 17-dollars, that would be about the same cost for a replacement head, for a cheap shaver, might as well buy a new one, even if my old one still works. I then decided it was time to go and update my review to reflect the longevity I got out of my old shaver.<br /><br />Only to discover that it wasn't 1-year that I've owned my shaver like I thought, but 2-years! My oh my how time flies. That means, that I have been shaving on the original cutting head for 2-years, thats unheard of for electric shavers, holy cow! So there is my longevity review guys, 2-years, still kicking, just needs a new head, but no replacement head in stock. 17-dollars is all I had to pay to buy a new shaver, its a no brainer. So, guys, if your looking for a shaver that is going to get the job done, this is what you need. Now, if the company can get replacement heads back in stock that would be great. But for now, you can just buy a new shaver when your head goes dull.<br /><br />I am keeping my review at 5-STARS!  :)<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />I have used several electric shavers in my life, all of them being Norelco. I was never a fan of the two-bladed shavers, I grow a thick beard, and it just takes too long to shave with those things. The 3-bladed shavers can be hit or miss depending on brand/model. Norelco used to make quality shavers back in the 80's and 90's. Since Phillips's acquisition of the Norelco brand however, the quality has gone down drastically. Many reviews complain of underpowered motors, motors burning out early, and poor shaving quality, unless of course you buy the high end 200 dollar model, then your in heaven lol.<br /><br />Thankfully these day, we have a choice. I don't know about you, but I am not in the rich income bracket, I can't just dump 200 dollars into a shaver just to get something that is quality.  Fortunately, there are many different types of shavers made in China now, that are much more affordable. What sold me on this shaver, is that it uses a 800MAH lithium rechargeable battery, that can be charged via USB. It uses a pretty blue LED battery indicator display, which shows minutes of run-time remaining.<br /><br />It uses a standard 3-bladed system, with a pop up side-burn trimmer. It is also easy to pop the blades off and clean them, and even though I didn't require this feature, it is also IPX7 waterproof. The shaver comes with a nice velvet pouch, a brush, USB cable, and a operators manual. When I turned the unit on, I couldn't believe how quiet this thing runs, most certainly quieter then the old 80's - 90's Norelco models. So the question you might be asking is, how does it perform?<br /><br />If all you have is stubble, you can expect this to provide a pretty smooth shave within a reasonable amount of time. I just did nice and slow rotational movements, as you are supposed to do with this type of shaver, and it did a pretty good job! If you let your beard get beyond a stubble, as one would expect, it does take longer to get the job done, but the shaver was able to do it, and seemed to have enough power, not just in time duration, but also in horse power.<br /><br />Since I did not do a wet shave with this, I can't speak as to its effectiveness. I bought an electric shaver for the convenience of a dry shave, as wet shaving is a pain in the but for me. While the water proof rating allows one to simply run the head under the water stream to clean it out, I however just used the brush that they supplied, and some canned air, and it did just as good, without fully taking the blades out of the head. Recharge time is faster then they state when utilizing a powerful Anker wall charger that puts out 3 amps. I charged my battery from 45 minutes left, to 60-minutes left, in only 20 minutes.<br /><br />In conclusion, I believe this to be a very nice electric shaver. And for the price I paid for it, I expected it to be weaker in construction, however, that is further from the truth. The construction of this shaver is top notch, and rivals higher end Phillips Norelco's in my humble opinion. If you need a quality electric shaver that will get the job done, and doesn't break the bank, I highly recommend this one! 5 out of 5 stars!", "helpful_vote": 147, "verified_purchase": true}, {"rating": 4.0, "title": "Daughter likes it, yet only displays in Celsius", "text": "My daughter says that she uses this on the highest setting which is 230 degrees Celsius .

I will say that the paper backings don\u2019t peel off smoothly every time, and the fabric has a slight tendency to wrinkle and ripple, so the covers don\u2019t stay completely flat throughout the entire duration of wear. The rippled texture is still somewhat visible under t-shirts, the edges are slightly detectable, and I think I\u2019d have to layer two of them together to really ensure full coverage. I\u2019ve had no adverse reactions to the adhesive component, they peel off easily, and I even wore a pair while sweating in the summer heat in Texas, and they stayed firmly in place.", "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 2.0, "title": "I don\u2019t do silicones (and petrolatum)", "text": "I heard a lot of good things about this brand but after trying it / seeing the ingredients list I wasn\u2019t too happy. My favorite is the moisture essence with 100% plant based squalane. It doesn\u2019t have anything else and that is the only product I don\u2019t mind using on my skin. It doesn\u2019t have any offensive scents and odors, and I like the way it makes my skin feel. That product is 5 stars for me. However, the other two, Skin Refiner and Moisture Boost, I am not sold on because of the ingredients. When I first used the skin refiner I loved how it felt - goes on smoothly, glides through my skin, and melts into it like butter. I looked at the ingredients only to see that it is, of course, filled with silicone (siloxane and petrolatum). I should have looked at it first before trying. I know studies may have shown that silicones are ok for skin, but for me personally I just don\u2019t want that on my face. As for the petrolatum, that is something I just don\u2019t want anywhere near my skin! While I loved the way it felt I didn\u2019t feel good about the stuff in it. The skin refiner also made my skin itchy and tingly, even though I tried on three separate occasions, so I had to stop using it. The good thing about these products is they are fragrance free.

While my heels haven\u2019t hurt or anything, they have been ugly. In a search for solutions, I found this foot scrubber and decided it was likely going to work better for me than a foot rasp, and I ordered it. It\u2019s a great tool and it works well, though I do offer some caution for those who haven\u2019t worked with a foot scrubber or rasp in the past.<br /><br />This is an odd-looking instrument, vaguely similar to a comma in shape. The scraping side somewhat resembles a mirror with a patterned rough edge. It feels a lot like an emery board though it has more of a \u201cbite\u201d to the surface, if that makes sense. The overall size and shape make it easy to grip and hold, even when wet.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I scraped away a fairly large amount of dead skin, to the point that I had feeling in parts of my heels where I have had no feeling for quite some time. It left my heels soft, pink and looking much better. However, I did discover that one can overdo, and I had nicked myself on each heel in one or two places, just enough to require blotting but not enough to really be a concern (it was less serious than a cut while shaving).<br /><br />I discovered the following day what happens when you remove too much dead skin and don\u2019t put enough lotion on an area that deals with weight and stress \u2013 my heels split in a couple of places and I ended up having difficulty walking without pain for a couple of days. I had put high-quality lotion on my heels, but apparently not enough. That was entirely my mistake, and it was a painful one.<br /><br />After that finally healed up, I tried again. I have fallen into a daily routine where I gently scrub my heels for a couple of minutes each, then apply lotion. My heels now look much better, they\u2019re not splitting when I put weight on them, and I have avoided nicking myself. At least in my case this is not a tool that gets used intensely every couple of weeks, but rather it is a daily tool that gets used very gently.<br /><br />I got curious and put this tool under a digital microscope to see what the rough surface looked like. The roughness resembles a series of crescents, not dissimilar to a rasp, but much more fine.<br /><br />This thing really works and it does a good job. It\u2019s slightly more expensive than the average foot rasp but it seems to work well.

I understand the metal was likely placed there to protect the blade and prevent unnecessary dulling and the build up of gunk.

I tried using some bentonite clay as it says you  can use it as a mud mask, but it ended up clumpy and hard to spread on my face. I always ended up making too much too, which only wasted it. It was too much trouble and I stopped using it. I decided to give the dead sea mud mask a go. It is much darker than I expected, my entire face was blue/grey. It's very easy to spread on, I just used one finger and small swisp on each section of my face. It doesn't take too much, I figured it would take a big scoop, but really it took much less.

So my main recommendation is that you shouldn't let the vacuum \"feature\" be your reason for buying this.  If anything, it's a slight negative, because the opening for the vacuum gets in the way when you are doing edge trimming without the attachment.<br />The next down-side is the \"memory\" rechargeable batteries.  Basically, unless you let the batteries completely discharge before recharging, they will hold less and less charge each time.  This is mentioned in the folded up piece of paper that passes for a manual--you will want to read through that.  Which leads me to my final gripe:  That piece of paper is extremely poorly done--diagrams with no explaination, unclear instructions, etc.  So you do have to read it, but you're going to spend some time trying to puzzle it out before you actually figure it out.<br />For all my complaining, the trimmer isn't completely without merit.  It does do a decent job of trimming my beard, which is of course the main point of the thing.

Sure, different monitors, screens, etc etc, but everything else has been spot on, EXCEPT this polish.<br /><br />First off, I love the rubberized top. It makes it so easy to handle. The polish itself flowed well and went on smoothly.<br /><br />My beef is the huge color difference. I've already opened it, I can't return it. It totally looks rosy and pearlized in the photos on Amazon. BUT, in reality, it is mauve, nearly purple. The color name is \"Pinky Promise\", so the minimum I expected was a shade of pink. They should change the name to \"Purple Promise\", which would be much more accurate. It is so different, I thought maybe I was sent the wron bottle. But the sticker on the bottom has the right name. Maybe someone messed with stickers?<br /><br />It is not a horrible color, but not what I wanted, and very dark for me. Very disappointing. The quality is ok, but the shade is WAY off from the photo and name.<br /><br />UPDATE: Found the weakness in this polish. Despite it being so dark, I wanted to test the \"breathable\" polish, as I'd never tried it. I have to say that it lasted really well. I put it on with no bottom or top coat, just the polish.

I\u2019m not even entire sure I can utilize this..<br /><br />First the roller part detaches from the lid easily. On unboxing and just checking out the tool I placed the cap back on the tool and then when i went to remove it for first use the roller ball came right off the top. It took me about 15 minutes to be able to twist lock the rolled ball back to the lid. (First photo) Once I got the roller ball re attached and tried to place ice in the main compartment I found you cant get regular shaped ice in. Only broken ice will fit into the packaging. Secondly, the first time I place ice in it the roller was not cold at all what so ever. I actually had to place ice, let it melt and then place a second round of fresh ice in it for the roller ball to actually get cold. Thirdly, it has no fluid control at all what so ever. So when using this with ice or if the ice melts at all it will just profusely leak water all over where ever you\u2019re applying it. So that rules out me being able to use this with massage oil.<br /><br />I do like the size of the jade roller and I feel like the concept is there it just needs better packaging.

The product is well packaged and easy to use.  I am 54 years old and after the first night I used it, I woke up the next morning and my face was red and a bit swollen.  At first I thought maybe I was having an allergic reaction.  I noticed after one use my skin was much smoother, as if the top layer of dead skin came off.  I gave my face a few days of a break, as this product seems to be a strong one, and reluctantly tried it again.  I did not have the same reaction with the redness and swelling.  So I kept using this product, but as it is a strong one, I use it only 2-3 times a week.  After about a couple of weeks using it, I discovered all kinds of undesirable things coming out of the pores of my skin, I developed little pussy sores and pimples, but the pimples were not like the regular pimple, these were deep and what came out was really think and sometimes hard.  Instead of having what I thought was an allergic reaction, I think this product was pulling impurities out of my skin and detoxing it.  I also had a couple of small, sebaceous cysts on my forehead and after about a month of using this product, they were gone!  I was told by a plastic surgeon the only way to get rid of them was surgery but I didn't want the scar on my forehead so never had anything done about them, I had them for years.  To this day, the cysts are gone.  My skin no longer reacts as if impurities are being pulled out.  There is still a small amount of burning on the nights I use this product but if I follow it up with argon oil or rose hip oil, the burning goes away.  I've noticed my skin is a firmer, smoother in texture, very soft, and the skin tone is more even.

The heigh adjustment click in nicely. The cover over the blades ride nicely over your face but this is something you'll have to use the included cleaning brush to wipe out hair that will stick in it's nicks and crannies.<br /><br />There is a second blade that is used for finer detailing like around your mouth. It works well and enables you to keep the hair out of your mouth. Funny thing about the attachments. The first few times you change them or remove the hair catcher they seem to be difficult to remove. But soon they pop off easily.

Its nice to be able to go to your page and just cut off a new one and not worry if it's the same size as the others.

I wet it with alcohol and rub with dry toilet tissue.  The dry helps rub the transfer off.  It's not super pleasant, but it works.<br />5-  They last for me for two full days.<br />6-  As crazy as it sounds, I followed the advice of someone here and shaved my (small) brows after trying to apply over my natural brows.  I was very freaked out about shaving my brows, but my brows sucked anyhow and it improved the look of these by far!<br />7-  My advice is to try all or almost all of the varieties sent in the package.  It can't hurt to try, right?!  Remember you can always remove them if you really can't stand them. Some of the ones that looked very odd on paper, looked not bad on me!  Some look better on \"natural\" days and some look better with make-up.  I wear the ones I don't hate on days I'm just staying home and I save my favs for the days I go out.<br />8-  The eyebrow print is on the front AND the back, so you can hold them up in the mirror to place correctly.

Taking two stars off is for packaging, shipment, and customer service. So I ran out of nail polish remover not that long ago and have been looking for a better way to remove the nail polish with out all the chemicals. To my surprise I found this and was excited to try a all natural nail polish remover.  Made with all plant based ingredients which is a huge plus for me. I hate the way traditional nail polish remover smells and I hate using that stuff for my daughters nails. Now I feel comfortable using this with my daughter so she does not have to breath in those harsh fumes. I did not have any nail polish on at first so I put some on and let it dry. Once it was dry I put one to two drops on each nail then waited about 2 to 3 minutes. It wiped right off on all the nails except one small spot that came off with one more drop.<br /><br />When this bottle arrived it was leaking all over the box. The seal was broken and the plastic wrapped around the lid was torn. So I had very little left in the bottle. I contacted the seller to let them know and to see about getting a replacement bottle. I took some time to get a response but they did respond. After the second email they sent a code for a replacement. That code did not work so I reached out to them again. They said it is on amazon and that the code has worked for others. I tried multiple times and the code did not work. So even if it is on amazon to supply correct codes, the seller needs to do their part in making the experience pleseant with the customer and this was not that.<br /><br />Still pleased with the product itself though.<br /><br />I received this free or reduced price for product testing and review.

This mask is the first mask I\u2019ve seen which contains kaolin clay. You leave the mask on like any other sheet mask, but after you take off the mask, you can see a thin layer of gray clay on your face. You have to rinse that off.  After I rinsed off the mask and applied my usual Cerave cream moisturizing cream, I felt that my skin looked noticeably brighter.<br /><br />These masks are expensive. They cost $6.00 each (a pack of 5 costs $30.00 on Amazon). Although the two-piece mask fit my face, did not slide off, and is the only sheet mask I know which incorporates kaolin, I found the floral, perfume fragrance overwhelming. A sheet mask should be enjoyable and not make you want to hold your breath.<br /><br />Instead of buying this mask again, I want to try clay/kaolin/bentonite masks and continue to use masks with some of the same ingredients as this mask (e.g., niacinamide (brightens skin but can be irritating for some people), allantoin (soothing), centella asiatica extract (soothing), and dipotassium glycyrrhizate (potential brightening effect)).<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE CLAY MASK: I highly recommend the ISNTREE Real Mugwort Clay Mask* ($23.60 for 3.38 fl oz). There is a strong earthy, herbal scent when you apply the mask, but it disappears quickly. I noticed decreased redness using this mask. It has been more effective than any sheet mask I have tried.<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE SHEET MASKS: To brighten skin, try Keana Nadeshiko Rice Mask 10 Pieces Japan** (10 sheets for $9.50). The fragrance free masks contain glycerin (moisturizing), rice ferment filtrate (sake) and rice bran for a skin brightening effect.<br /><br />* https://www.amazon.com/Blackheads-Whiteheads-Moisturizing-Sensitive-Extracts/dp/B07KQYWBP7/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3BHFM1SJVHDQD&keywords=innisfree+clay+mask&qid=1656954243&sprefix=innisfree+clay+mask%2Caps%2C43&sr=8-7<br /><br />** https://www.amazon.com/Keana-Nadeshiko-Rice-Pieces-Japan/dp/B018FM03CO/ref=psdc_11061121_t1_B00IFROMCM<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading my review.

It intrigued me because some seemed to like it and report that it was well made. Also, like the new Fendrihan razors, it has an unusual head: Closed comb on one side; open comb on the other. I think the idea is that it offers two levels of aggression. The Lutz slant offers a similar choice of two levels of aggression.<br /><br />In use I found that both sides offered about the same level of aggression. Another reason for the test is that it's a low cost razor; under $13 currently on Amazon. I'm always intrigued by potential bargains!<br /><br />A further unusual feature is the exceptionally long handle. Longer than the Futur, longer than my Mergress, Schick Krona, or even my long handled Gillette Starburst, (aimed at the ladies\u201d market); longer in fact than any razor I own. To some this is a plus, to others not so. It may be useful if ladies wish to use the razor on their legs, or other parts. The razor is well balanced so the long handle presented no problem.<br /><br />The razor comes with a box of five blades. I have no idea of their origin. But since the razor is Chinese, I expect China.<br /><br />The Blade used for the Test<br />I chose to use the Rapira Platinum Lux. I've found this blade to be consistent and reliable in just about every razor (but there are some razors where it's an indifferent pairing, say with my RR Wunderbar), and it's always good for at least four shaves, often six, in just about any razor. It's sharp, smooth, comfortable, very cheap to buy, and easily available, and my personal favorite of the Rapira line. I've also used it every DE razor I own at one time or another, and I own over 50 DE safety razors . Not my favorite blade, but a very good one in most razors. I used a brand new blade<br /><br />How I Used this Razor for the Test<br />When using an adjustable razor, (and following advice from others on this forum, including Jim Chandler, plus my own long experimentation) I've found the best way, for the smoothest and most comfortable shave is to INCREASE the aggression with each pass. It seems counter-intuitive at first but it really works best. It's like lowering the blade on a lawn mower to get a closer cut. I increased the aggression on each pass on this test.<br /><br />Since this razor supposedly offered two choices of aggression I used the Acevivi in this way: Less aggressive WTG and XTG, then more aggressive ATG and for buffing. I'm assuming that closed comb is less aggressive, though as some have reported with the Fendrihan, this is not always the case.<br /><br />Now in previous reviews, I notice that some people seem to miss this point. I really believe that this is the best way to get a very smooth, comfortable, and importantly irritation-free shave with an adjustable razor. I have a complete thread on this method. Please review the thread and give it a whirl, and report what you find please!<br /><br />The Routine<br />For testing I go through the same routine. I clean my face and wet the beard by washing with a glycerin soap. I rinse off the soap, wet it thoroughly and apply two drops of a pre-shave oil.<br /><br />By the way, I believe good pre-shave prep not only produces a better shave, but reduces irritation, and keeps you skin in good condition. I know of one rather famous reviewer whose skin frankly looks irritated, red, blotchy and awful, especially on his neck. I don't doubt he gets close shaves, but at what cost?<br /><br />I use an Arko shave stick applied directly to the beard and lather with a Stirling Synthetic \u201cKong\u201d brush. I rinse and lather again between passes. I thoroughly rinse the head of the razor between passes.<br /><br />I remove the blade from the razor when I'm done. I dry it with a microfiber cloth. Naturally I dry the razor too when I'm done.<br /><br />I finish with an Alum block, which is a good indicator of razor burn or irritation. Then after washing it off , I apply Thayer's Alcohol Free Witch Hazel.<br /><br />The Shave<br />I shaved 22 hours before doing a test comparison of the Parker Variant and Ming Shi 2000s, so my face had a little less than average growth.<br /><br />First Pass WTG: Closed Comb Side<br />Fairly smooth, reasonably efficient. Not good enough for a one pass shave.<br /><br />Second Pass XTG: Closed Com Side<br />Not especially smooth and after the pass I wasn't especially happy with the hair removal. It still felt like there was a lot of hair, but I press on! Still not good enough even for everyday.<br /><br />Third Pass ATG: Open Comb Side<br />Quite scratchy. I could feel the blade and I didn't enjoy the pass much. A lost of hair remained. Quite disappointing. Not a good shave at all.<br /><br />Buff up and J-hooking<br />I would have had to spend an age buffing and cleaning up because the beard was still quite rough, and frankly my face already felt quite irritated. So I did not buff with the Acevivi. There are limits to my testing zeal!<br /><br />Finishing the Shave:<br />Sometimes a specific blade is no good. In the interests of fairness, I took the blade out and put it in my most efficient razor, the RR Wunderbar slant (which incidentally is not a blade this razor likes a lot) and had to shave again, because the shave with the Acevivi was just not good enough even for everyday.<br /><br />I then did another ATG pass, and boy, was there a lot to remove! The jawline and neck still had a lot of growth. The blade performed well in the Wunderbar, so I don't think one can't blame the blade.<br /><br />Now I'm not comparing a $13 razor to a $130. That would be grossly unfair. I just wanted to see if the blade was to blame, and frankly I didn't want to irritate my face more than necessary.<br /><br />I did a clean up and buffing pass, using the Wunderbar and got a BBS shave. However the feedback from alum block revealed a lot of irritation, not surprising given three indifferent and inefficient passes with the Acevivi, followed by another ATG pass and cleanup with the Wunderbar, though I don't blame the latter. No nicks, cuts, or weepers, but definite neck irritation.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The razor is well made, and low in price, and I admire the innovation, but I cannot recommend the Acevivi, unless you want to get a very long handle that's well made for under $13. It's possible that it will do better with other blades, but my initial impression is that it's not really worth testing. It's a fairly mild and quite inefficient razor.<br /><br />Is it good value? No! The Ming Shi 2000s Adjustable is cheaper (aroud $10 from China) and better in every possible way. The following razors, all under $20 are much, much better: The RazoRock (RR) German 37 Slant, the Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements  Bakelite slant, the RR Slab, the RR Mission, the RR Old Type, the RR Jaws (if you can get it), and probably some others too.<br /><br />It's a pretty poor razor, and even at the low price not worth it. I wouldn't recommend it to newbies, because it will put them off DE shaving.

The texture of the product was gloppy and grainy, not smooth as anticipated.  The color was a muddy, grayish brown, not the rich, lovely warm brown I was expecting/hoping for.  Mainly I feel the product dyed the skin under my brows and I don't anticipate it lasting long on the hairs.

I was tired of paying $35 to have a dip manicure so I invested in a kit and started doing them myself. Now filing my nails seems to be the bane of my existence so that why I purchased this drill. It's small and inexpensive which is what we're clearly looking for. I read lots of reviews that spoke of this unit being portable but let me clarify. IT DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT BEING CONNECTED TO A SHORT CORD! Let me tell you what a pain that is! Based on the other reviews I thought I could charge it, then walk around freely with it. No such luck. You have to keep it plugged in. Bummer. I also dislike the package did not come with instructions on how to use the nail bits or what they are for. Or even directions on how to put them in. Thank you to the people who posted videos. I had to do some research and found this great video that explained everything about the nail bits. [...] . Put those things aside this drill is pretty darn good for the price. It isn't strong and I like that. Like I said I'm a rookie at doing nails so the last thing I need is a powerful drill that murders my cuticles. Yes, it does stop if you apply too much pressure. That's a plus in my opinion - another safety feature for me. It does a great job of filing down old dip powder just enough so soaking them off doesn't take forever. It's great to smooth out your dip mani when it's too thick. The unit does get warm when used but has never clonked out on me.

I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.", "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}, {"rating": 3.0, "title": "Did not work for me.", "text": "This item was too far off from my hair for me to use.

Shaving and I have never been friends.  I usually can only use a Mach III blade 2 times (3 times max) before I have to throw it away, else it turns my face into blood salad.<br /><br />As such, electric shavers have never done that good of a job on my face.  I always use an electric shaver first to get the big chunks of hair off so that the Mach III can go in for precision, but in no way shape or form can I use an electric shaver alone and then go out into public.  This is especially true of the neck area.<br /><br />For years, I've been using the Norelco line of shavers (most recently the 3000) as my choice.  The three-circle-blades-in-a-triangle works best for me, especially on that stubborn neck area.  It isn't necessarily the closest shave, but it does get the most hair removed overall.  And its usable in the shower.<br /><br />Enter this Wahl shaver.  Right out the gate, I'll say that on the parts it does shave properly (flat open areas like sideburns), it cuts super close.  It also charges very quickly, behaves well in the shower, and is easy to clean.  But that doesn't really set it apart, since many shavers also do this.  I like the carry bag it comes with.<br /><br />What I don't like is that it does REALLY bad work on the curved parts of the face such as the aforementioned neck area.  In fact, it's almost useless there.  I had to clean up with the Norelco after using the Wahl, and I did several test runs.  The Wahl performed a little bitter with shaving cream, but then again, so does the Norelco.<br /><br />Maybe if your face isn't gnarly and coarse like mine, this Wahl is for you.

But does clean well", "text": "I've been using my Clarisonic on and off for the past few years and it's a pain to purchase the replacement brushes for that. It also kind of grosses me out that the bacteria can live in those bristles..the ones that are supposed to DEEP CLEAN you face! I've been wanting to try the Foreo Luna for a while but that costs $200!  this item looks almost identical to that Luna cleansing brush. My friend uses her Luna and swears by it now. I compared hers to this one and i think the shape of this facial brush is a lot more practical since it comes to that point at the top which is great around the eye, nose, mouth areas. However, looking at the Luna bristles and the bristles on this unit you can tell the Luna has their bristles closer and also has a great variety of  brush levels which their claim is to more efficiently cleanse the skin meeting the specific needs of different facial areas... compared to the Sytles II, this unit only has 2 types of bristles.  The Luna says it cleanses with 8,000 pulsations per minute, but this unit says it can &#34;reach 32,000 times per minute massage design if high frequency vibration&#34; ...which i'm not sure how true that is..and what that even means.... what is 32,000 times? What is it referring to?...this leads me to my other gripe with this product...........the instructions!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I wish this unit had BETTER INSTRUCTIONS...I was reading it and i'm so confused - it doesn't say how many modes it has and what each mode is used for..but it mentions &#34;modes&#34; have eight gears?<br /><br />Here's the &#34;operation&#34; instructions..please try to decipher what it means... and yes i know there's typos..but that is how it READS on the instruction manual...&#34;each mode has eight gear, may adjust the intensity according to your needed. According to the intermediate key open product cleaning mode for the first tiem. According to the second closed products the intensity of each mode can be though the + and - buttons to increase&#34;............excuse me what? anyway ...<br /><br />Here are my instructions!!!<br />1.) Charge the unit to full before first use. Flashing means it's charging and when it stops blinking it is fully charged.<br /><br />2.) Wet the unit and your face, apply some face wash and turn the unit on to cleanse your whole face for 2 minutes. This unit has 2 modes, cleanse and massage. When you press on the button between the - and + you have it on cleanse mode (the faster vibration) and you can adjust the vibration intensity higher or lower depending on what you prefer. When you press the middle button again it turns off ..when you press it one more time it will turn onto the massage mode (slower vibration) you can adjust the speed of vibration in this mode as well.<br />  -The unit does NOT have a self timer so don't expect this unit to shut off after 2 minutes of cleaning. It also says it has &#34;acoustic cleaning&#34; which i thought meant it would beep every 30 seconds indicating you should move to another part of your face (ex. left cheek, right cheek, chin and then forehead - like the clarisonic does) but does NOT so you need to keep track of how long you want to wash your face for with this.<br /><br />3) Shut the unit off when you're finished by clicking the middle button between the - and +. Pat the unit dry or leave it where it can air dry.<br /><br />One thing i like about this type of facial brush is that you don't need to replace any brush heads on this unit - it makes for more hygienic. This Styles II facial brush also claims to reverse signs of aging and restoring youth in your skin. I'm only 27 so i can't really speak to this claim, i don't have may wrinkles but i hope this is a great start for preventative measures.<br /><br />This unit also claims to be a durable travel sized facial brush - it feels very light weight which i like because i don't want a bulky unit, i really like that the cord is very small and doesn't need a stand charging unit like the clarisonic. I haven't used this enough to know how long one charge can hold but I'll let you know once i continue to use this consistently. Be sure to read the instructions because it says you NEED to charge the unit fully before your first use. When you plug it in you will see the light at the bottom to start flashing indicating that it is actively charging. I hope this unit will last forever as it claims - wouldn't that be AMAZING! :)<br /><br />I've already used this unit last night and i can say that my face felt very smooth and clean afterwards. I think it really preps the skin well for your serums and treatments at night, which is KEY for those products to work. If you don't exfoliate and clean your skin - it won't allow your products to actively work!<br /><br />I'm really excited for the 100% money back guarantee! I've only had this unit for one night so I don't know how i like it yet for the long term but I'm glad that this warranty is here in case it doesn't work well for my skin or if it breaks....<br /><br />Pros:<br />\u2022 Compact and easy to travel with<br />\u2022 Cute color!<br />\u2022 Comes with a charging cable ...which it came with a case too.<br />\u2022 Waterproof so you can use it in the shower<br />\u2022 Rechargeable - you can see the image where I'm charging the unit and the light is blinking. Once it stops blinking i'm assuming that is when it's fully charged.<br /><br />Cons:<br />\u2022 The plug for the adapter to connect seems like it could rip over time - you can see it in the picture, it's very flimsy...<br />\u2022 The user manual has very odd grammar and is hard to understand which side is for &#34;massaging&#34; and which side if for &#34;cleansing&#34;.  PLEASE edit your instructions so we all understand how to properly use it.<br />\u2022 Does NOT have a self timer and it does NOT beep to indicate when to move to another part of your face like the clarisonic or Luna do.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest review. I love face products and purchasing things on Amazon so this is truly my honest review.  I think this is worth the $40 price tag for what it does.

I've only worked on my white chihuahua-blend's tear stains once with the All About Health Network Charcoal konjac sponge, but it did seem like it lightened his tear stains a bit. They're pretty significant now since he doesn't like his face washed. What was most important to me is that he actually seemed to like me cleaning his face with the sponge. It's very soft once hydrated, and the shape meant I could be careful not to get too near to his eyes. I also have a white frenchie who absolutely HATES having her face washed, but needs to have the folds of her face cleaned regularly. I'm going to order a second one because this has made that process much easier as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don't yet know if it can remove tear stains, but given how hard they are to get rid of I somehow doubt it.
